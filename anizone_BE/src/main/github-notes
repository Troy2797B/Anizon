The routine for adding things to Git

1. Make the feature branch:
    git checkout -b feature/specific-feature-name
        *NOTE: you can use a different prefix on the branch based on what you are doing.
        feature/ for new features.
        bugfix/ for bug fixes.
        hotfix/ for critical bug fixes that need to go directly into production.
        release/ for preparing release candidates.
        chore/ for routine tasks or minor fixes.
        refactor/ for code refactoring that isn't directly tied to bug fixes or new features.

2. Add your changes locally

3. Commit the changes locally:
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added functionality to add notes to the application."

4. Push the changes to the remote repository
    git push -u origin feature/specific-feature-name
    *NOTE: The -u flag sets the upstream (remote tracking) reference, so in subsequent pushes, you can simply use git push without needing to specify the origin and branch.
    ALSO: Remember to do regular pushes to the remote repository as well as doing Pull Requests, even when working solo to maintain a clean history.

5. Once you are satisfied with the development in your feature branch, switch to the development branch.
    git fetch //fetches the latest from the remote, just to ensure we are not behind
    git checkout dev

6. Pull the latest changes to ensure your local branch is up to date with the remote.
    git pull

7. Merge your feature branch into the development branch.
    git merge feature/specific-feature-name

8. Push these changes to the remote repository.
    git push origin dev

9. Delete the local feature branch
    git branch -d feature/specific-feature-name

10.Delete Remote Branch
    git push origin --delete feature/specific-feature-name

11.Using Tags for Releases
    When you merge significant changes, or periodically in your development process, consider tagging your commits in the dev or master branch. This can help in marking
    release points or significant updates, which is particularly useful for versioning and rollbacks:

    git tag -a v1.2 -m "Release version 1.2"
    git push origin v1.2

Mockito general syntax:

// 1. Mock the dependency
@Mock MyService myService;

// 2. Setup behavior
when(myService.someMethod("input")).thenReturn("output");

// 3. Call the thing you’re testing
String result = classUnderTest.callMyService();

// 4. Verify it did what you expected
assertEquals("output", result);
verify(myService).someMethod("input");

For WebClient:

when(webClient.get()).thenReturn(mockHeadersUriSpec);
when(mockHeadersUriSpec.uri(any())).thenReturn(mockHeadersSpec);
when(mockHeadersSpec.retrieve()).thenReturn(mockResponseSpec);
when(mockResponseSpec.bodyToMono(String.class)).thenReturn(Mono.just("yay"));
